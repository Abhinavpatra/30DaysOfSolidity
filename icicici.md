Note: Please complete the mandatory questionnaire below to proceed with your candidature.

1. What are your career aspirations. How do you propose to accomplish your career goals? (300 words)? *
   1. As of now, my career aspiration is to gain a clear understanding of how the industry functions and build a strong foundation for long-term growth. I want to use my first few years to get a feel for real-world challenges, learn from experienced professionals, and develop the discipline needed to succeed in demanding environments. Getting the right foot into the door for me means not just finding a job, but finding the right ecosystem that will allow me to learn at scale, contribute meaningfully, and grow faster. In the long run, I wish to become a morer esponsible professional who not only executes but also strategizes, someone who can bridge technology, operations, and business goals. Ultimately, I see myself in a role where I am helping design and manage systems that serve millions of people efficiently, securely, and sustainably. A firm as large and established as ICICI provides the perfect platform to learn, experiment, and take on diverse roles. I believe this environment will give me the chance to grow exponentially while contributing to the organization’s success.

2. Why do you want to join ICICI Bank? (300 words)? *
   1.  ICICI has achieved an upward revenue of over 35 billion US dollars and has maintained a Tier 1 rating for the longest time. Not only that, the bank was also primarily responsible for setting up India’s first professional credit rating agency. This alone shows that failure is not casually acceptable at ICICI, and they have a huge team that works in an incredibly smart and sustainable way for employees, shareholders, and customers. I am very eager to be a part of that team, to learn and contribute as much as I possibly can, and to leave a mark in the legacy of your firm.

    The number of crashes being so many times fewer than the other companies of relative size and scale speaks volumes about your DevOps team, and I wish to grasp as much as I can when working there. I like reading a lot about how big US and Chinese tech giants work on optimizing their sites and data handling, and your company would prove a valuable ground for me to engage in such high-level discussions while being able to implement and see real-time changes as time goes forward.

    I have always had some fascination with the approach that ICICI takes in constantly upgrading its digital services to make banking simpler while updating it to new specs. I personally find it admirable, given the size of your entire business, how you choose to do the difficult task of implementing these features. I am also quite interested in how UI/UX decisions are made to ensure that even complex financial services remain easy for customers to navigate. This reflects ICICI’s strong focus on customer-centric innovation, and I believe that being part of such a team will allow me to contribute to making these digital experiences even smoother and more accessible. These reasons seem quite lengthy when it comes to answering why I would like to work with you, apart from the money.


3. Which of the following possibilities appeal to you more and why? Kindly explain with reasons. (300 words)? *
   1. The possibilities that appeal to me most are those that allow me to understand how the industry functions at scale, while contributing to impactful technology and operations projects. As of now, my career aspiration is to gain a clear understanding of how the industry functions and build a strong foundation for long-term growth. I want to use my first few years to get a feel for real-world challenges, learn from experienced professionals, and develop the discipline needed to succeed in demanding environments. Getting the right foot into the door for me means not just finding a job, but finding the right ecosystem that will allow me to learn at scale, contribute meaningfully, and grow faster.

    I am particularly interested in understanding how large-scale systems operate, how the team at ICICI handles such a high number of visits and requests without crashing, and how they are constantly optimizing performance down to the millisecond. The number of crashes being so many times fewer than other companies of relative size and scale speaks volumes about your DevOps and operations teams, and I wish to grasp as much as I can when working there.

    At the same time, I want to make it clear that I am not particularly inclined towards pursuing a role in sales, as my curiosity and enthusiasm are much stronger in fields like technology, operations, product development, and analytics. I want to immerse myself in the systems, decision-making, and problem-solving processes that keep an organization like ICICI running at scale, and contribute in areas where my skills and interests can add maximum value.

4. a) Are you willing to move to any part of the country, away from your hometown? Why/why not? (150 words)? *
   1. Yes, i believe that 20s and 30s are for working and figuring out your own life away from that which you were borin into, so if work takes me somewhere, then for the right pay, I will be more than willing to go and work, as required of me, duty comes first.

5. Would you prefer to start your career in sales role with ICICI Bank? Why?/Why not (300 words)? *
   1. Although, people generally find me quite palatable to talk to and associate with, since I have spent a good chunk of my youth travelling to different states and cities for tournaments. Being able to talk to people is not something I seek a lot, since I have never had a problem with it in the first place. I am primarily interested in knowing more about the day-to-day handling of the massive infrastructure that the team at ICICI has built. How they are able to handle such a high number of visits and requests without crashing, and how they are constantly optimizing to improve milliseconds of performance, is something I am incredibly interested in learning more about.
